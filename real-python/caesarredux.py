""" Caesar Cipher Redux, without using standard library
    A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter of the
    plain text is substituted with a letter found by moving n places down the
    alphabet. For example, assume the input plain text is the following:

        abcd xyz

    If the shift value, n, is 4, then the encrypted text would be the following:

        efgh bcd

    You are to write a function that accepts two arguments, a plain-text
    message and a number of letters to shift in the cipher. The function will
    return an encrypted string with all letters transformed and all
    punctuation and whitespace remaining unchanged.

    Note: You can assume the plain text is all lowercase ASCII except for
    whitespace and punctuation.
